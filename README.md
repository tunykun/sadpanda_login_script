Installation + test:
1. download chrome driver (make sure it's the same version as the chrome you have installed)
2. create a folder called webdrivers and put the chrome driver in it. I put mine at the root. (ex: "c:\webdrivers\chromedriver.exe")
3. add the webdrivers folder to your path (ex: "c:\webdrivers\")
4. place the sadpanda script somewhere you can access it (ex: "c:\Users\USER_NAME\scripts\sadpanda.py") 
5. call the script from the command line (ex: "c:\Users\USER_NAME\scripts\ python sadpanda.py")
6. ????
7. profit

If my instructions aren't clear, search youtube for a way to add chrome driver to environmental path.
